title: "Welcome to My Digital Garden"

This website serves as my digital garden — a collection of Working Notes covering design, product, systems and more. 

I build things and love collaborating on experimental projects with like-minded people. I also mentor designers looking to grow. Drop me an email if you'd like to connect or explore ideas together. I live in Bangalore, if you're ever here — let's meet for a cup of coffee.
