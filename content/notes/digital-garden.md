A digital garden is a different way of thinking about your notes and personal knowledge.

   - Notes evolve over time
   - Not everything needs to be perfect
   - Ideas can be interconnected

2. **Natural Organization**
   - Notes link naturally, like plants in a garden
   - Categories help group related ideas
   - Growth stages show maturity

3. **Public Learning**
   - Share your learning journey
   - Notes can be work-in-progress
   - Encourage collaboration
