One of Grdn's core features is its support for bidirectional linking between notes. The Obsidian **wikilinks**, both direct link and with alias are supported as it is. 

Grdn automatically displays **backlinks** at the bottom of each note, showing which other notes reference the current one. This creates a network of connections that makes navigation intuitive. Backlinks help readers discover related content and understand the context of your [[Digital Gardens]].
