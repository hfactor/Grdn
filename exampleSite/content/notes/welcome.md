Grdn is a minimal, modern Hugo theme designed specifically for [[Digital Garden]] and Obsidian-compatible note management. The theme supports direct use of your Obsidian vault as content source, and is [[Digital Garden]]-Friendly. 

Wiki links are converted to proper links, and backlinks are listed at the bottom of each note. Check [[Wikilinks and Backlinks]] for more details. The site follows a [[Flat URL Structure]]. 

The theme comes with features including Search, Filter by Category, Growth Stage, Dark and Light theme and more. All such features are optional and can be enabled/disabled in the [[Theme Configs]].

This theme is open source and the source code is available at [Github](https://github.com/hfactor/grdn). You can contribute to the theme by raising an issue or a pull request.
