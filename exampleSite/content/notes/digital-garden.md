A digital garden is a collection of notes, thoughts, and ideas that grow and evolve over time. Unlike traditional blogs with chronological posts, digital gardens organize content by topic and connection.

#### Key Principles
1. **Non-linear**: Content is connected through [[Wikilinks and Backlinks]] rather than chronology
2. **Growing**: Notes evolve from [[Growth Stages|seedlings to evergreen content]]
3. **Personal**: Reflects your unique thinking and learning process

Grdn supports flexible folder structure, while the resulted website follows a [[Flat URL Structure]]. This helps in organizing the content without breaking the Obsidian experience you are used to.
