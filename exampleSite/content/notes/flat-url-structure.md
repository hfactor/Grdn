Grdn implements a flat URL structure that makes your notes accessible regardless of their folder location in your content directory.

A note at `content/notes/coffee/brewing.md` becomes accessible at `/notes/brewing`. This simplifies [[Wikilinks and Backlinks]] between notes and Navigation becomes more intuitive for readers

This approach focuses on the connections between ideas rather than hierarchical organization, supporting the non-linear nature of [[Digital Gardens]].
