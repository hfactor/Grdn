## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Hugo Extended](https://gohugo.io/installation/) (version 0.112.0 or later)
- An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault (optional, but recommended)

### Quick Start

1. **Create a new Hugo site** (skip if you already have one)
   ```bash
   hugo new site my-digital-garden
   cd my-digital-garden
   ```

2. **Add the Grdn theme**
   ```bash
   git init
   git submodule add https://github.com/hfactor/Grdn.git themes/Grdn
   ```

3. **Configure your site**
   
   Create or update your `config.toml` file with:
   ```toml
   baseURL = "https://example.com/"
   languageCode = "en-us"
   title = "My Digital Garden"
   theme = "Grdn"
   
   [params]
     # Enable/disable features
     enableSearch = true
     enableCategoryFilter = true
     enableGrowthFilter = true
     
     # Base path for notes
     notesPath = "/notes/"
   ```

4. **Add your notes**
   
   Place your markdown files in the `content/notes/` directory. If you're using Obsidian, you can set this folder as your vault.

5. **Start the Hugo server**
   ```bash
   hugo server -D
   ```

6. **Visit** `http://localhost:1313` to see your digital garden!

## üìù Note Structure

Grdn works best when your notes include frontmatter with metadata:

```markdown
---
title: "My Note Title"
date: 2023-06-15
category: "Programming"
growth: "seedling"
---

Note content with [[wikilinks]] to other notes.
```

### Growth Stages

The theme supports digital garden growth stages to indicate the maturity of your notes:

- `seedling`: Initial thoughts or early drafts
- `budding`: Developing ideas with some structure
- `evergreen`: Well-developed, mature content
The growth stages are coustomisable. You can change the growth stages by adding it in the frontmatter of your notes. Consider this as a seperate category.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

Create a `config.toml` file in your site's root directory. Here are the available options:

```toml
[params]
  # Core Features
  enableSearch = true           # Enable/disable search functionality
  enableCategoryFilter = true   # Enable/disable category filter
  enableGrowthFilter = true     # Enable/disable growth stage filter
  
  # Path Configuration
  notesPath = "/notes/"         # Base path for all notes
  
  # UI Configuration
  defaultTheme = "system"       # "light", "dark", or "system"
